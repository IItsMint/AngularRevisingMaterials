# AngularRevisingMaterials
In this repo, I will be revise the basics of the Angular Framework.

Why Angular,
<br>Angular is a single page application with a mvc (model-view-controller) architecutre.
<br>Angular is a framework that is using typescript.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revised Materials:

<br>#Components:<br>Components are building blocks of the application's UI. <br>Components consists of 3 files, .html, .ts, spec.ts and optional .css file for styling.

<br>#Services:<br>In angular, a service is a class that contains bussiness logic, data retrival or shared functionality, <br>that can be used across multiple components.

<br>#Directive:<br>Directive is a feature that is allowing us to extend behaviour of the HTML elements while executing during rendering phase.

<br>#Pipes:<br> A Pipe in angular is way to transform data in templates.<br>Pipes are use to Format, Filter or Manipiluate data before displaying to user, without changing the original data.

<br>#Guard:<br>In angular, a guard is a type of service used to controll navigation, and access to routes.<br>Guards determine whether a route can be activated, deactivated, loadded or if data can be resolved before navigaiton.

<br>#Data Binding / Event Handlers:<br>It i a mechanism that allow applicaiton to respond to user interactions. Such as, cliks, key presses or mouse movements.<br>Basically, it connects HTML template to a method in component, enabling the applicaiton execute logic when an event occurs.
<br>Property Binding:
<br>Two-Way Data Binding:

<br>#HTTP Module/Forms Module:

<br>#Routing:<br>Routing in angular allow us to create a single page applicaiton (SPA) by navigating between different views or components without reloading the entire page.<br>It manages the navigation and rendering of components based on the URL path.

<br>#State Management:

<br>#State Management:A standalone component is a self-contained unit that does not requeire being declared inside an anuglar module.<br>It can directly import dependencies such as, other components, directives, pipes or services without being part of a module.
